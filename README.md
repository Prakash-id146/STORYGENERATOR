# STORY GENERATOR
# this is our story generator project and try to explain in comments
# in each step why we use this command 
# here is two thing is needed AT LIST one is install to python package 
#  or libraries nltk , spacy , gensim 
# and another to download is python datasets that is punkit,stopwords
# here we install one libraries nltk

# nltk.corpus: This module provides access to 
# various text corpora. For example, it includes a collection o
# f stopwords, which are common words that are usually filtered
# out before processing text (e.g., "and", "the", "is").

# stopwords: The stopwords module in nltk contains a list of 
# common words in various languages that are often removed 
# from text to focus on more meaningful words.
# word_tokenize and sent_tokenize:
#     These functions are used to break down text into words
#     (word tokenization) and sentences (sentence tokenization).
# One of the commonly used classes is Counter,
# which is used to count the occurrences of 
# elements in a collection (like a list).
# Sample long story (you can replace this with your own story)
